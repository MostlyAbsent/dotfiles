;;   By disabling them early, we save Emacs some time.

;; HACK: I intentionally avoid calling `menu-bar-mode', `tool-bar-mode', and
;;   `scroll-bar-mode' because their manipulation of frame parameters can
;;   trigger/queue a superfluous (and expensive, depending on the window system)
;;   frame redraw at startup. The variables must be set to `nil' as well so
;;   users don't have to call the functions twice to re-enable them.

;; HACK: The menu-bar needs special treatment on MacOS. On Linux and Windows
;;   (and TTY frames in MacOS), the menu-bar takes up valuable in-frame real
;;   estate -- so we disable it -- but on MacOS (GUI frames only) the menu bar
;;   lives outside of the frame, on the MacOS menu bar, which is acceptable, but
;;   disabling Emacs' menu-bar also makes MacOS treat Emacs GUI frames like
;;   non-application windows (e.g. it won't capture focus on activation, among
;;   other things), so the menu-bar should be preserved there.
