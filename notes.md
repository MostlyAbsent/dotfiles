# TODO

- [ ] setup script for x in, stow -t $HOME x...

## tmux

- [ ] C-b b to swap windows feels gross. Maybe C-b C-b? Not sure. Maybe C-b is
  the wrong for leader.

## harpoon

- [ ] maybe a hard-coded shortcut to notes.  C-o is the back button, so not
  that. N is slot three. S is slot four. 

## markdown

- [ ] hanging indents on list paragraphs.
