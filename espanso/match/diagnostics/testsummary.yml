    replace: "These tests indicate a fault with the Display Module, repair would require a replacement Display."

  - trigger: "\\test"
    label: "Unreliable Drive"
    replace: "These tests indicate the Storage Drive is unreliable, and may be causing secondary issues. We recommend replacing this drive to best provide reliable use of the machine."

  - trigger: "\\test"
    label: "Old Drive"
    replace: "The drive is known to be older than four years, replacements for hard drives older than this are recommended due to increased chances of critical faults."

  - trigger: "\\test"
    label: "Failing Drive"

  - trigger: "\\test"
    label: "APFS"
    replace: "Since macOS Catalina Apple has been using the APFS format for its storage drives. This format is heavily optimised for Solid State drives, and it's able to more effectively and efficiently store data on Solid State drives. Unfortunately those optimisations negitively impact the speed and utility of rotational drives. You are using a rotational drive with APFS formatting, limiting the speed and responsiveness of your machine. We recommend replacing this rotational drive with a Solid State Drive to take advantage of the new features in APFS."

  - trigger: "\\test"
    label: "Full drive"
    replace: "The storage drive is quite full, with less than 10 GB of available we find machines frequently have unusual symptoms - slowness, failures to load, and other issues."
