# Test Summary Notes

matches:
  - trigger: "\\sum\\disp"
    replace: These tests indicate a fault with the Display Module, repair would require a replacement Display.

  - trigger: "\\sum\\drive\\un"
    replace: These tests indicate the Storage Drive is unreliable, and may be causing secondary issues. We recommend replacing this drive to best provide reliable use of the machine.

  - trigger: "\\sum\\drive\\old"
    replace: The drive is known to be older than four years, replacements for hard drives older than this are recommended due to increased chances of critical faults.

  - trigger: "\\sum\\drive\\fail"
    replace: The drive is reporting physical failures, we consider this drive to be unreliable, repair of the machine would require a replacement drive.

  - trigger: "\\sum\\drive\\rot"
    replace: Since macOS Catalina Apple has been using the APFS format for its storage drives. This format is heavily optimised for Solid State drives, and it able to more effectively and efficiently store data on Solid State drives. Unfortunately those optimisations negitively impact the speed and utility of rotational drives. You are using a rotational drive with APFS formatting, limiting the speed and responsiveness of your machine. We recommend replacing this rotational drive with a Solid State Drive to take advantage of the new features in APFS.

  - trigger: "\\sum\\test"
    form:
      These tests indicate a fault with the [[part]]. Repair of this fault would require a replacement [[part]].

  - trigger: "\\sum\\batt"
    replace: These tests indicate a fault with the Battery. A replacement battery would be needed to repair the machine.

  - trigger: "\\sum\\ld"
    replace: "There is significant liquid damage to multiple components in the machine.\n\n{{concld}}"
    vars:
      - name: concld
        type: match
        params:
          trigger: "\\conc\\ld"
